        <h1>Thinking about visiting San Juan?</h1>

<h2>San Juan is the capital and most-populous municipality in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the United States. As of the 2010 census, 
    it is the 46th-largest city under the jurisdiction of the United States, with a population of 395,326. San Juan was founded by Spanish colonists in 1521, who called it 
    Ciudad de Puerto Rico ("Rich Port City"). Puerto Rico's capital is the third oldest European-established capital city in the Americas, after Santo Domingo, 
    in the Dominican Republic, founded in 1496, and Panama City, in Panama, founded in 1521,[5] and is the oldest European-established city in the U.S. proper or U.S. 
    territories. Several historical buildings are located in San Juan; among the most notable are the city's former defensive forts, Fort San Felipe del Morro and Fort San 
    Crist√≥bal, and La Fortaleza, the oldest executive mansion in continuous use in the Americas.</h2>
